# 🐶 Dog Years Converter

A simple JavaScript project that converts human age into dog years. This project is part of my personal learning journey to sharpen my JavaScript fundamentals through real-world mini projects.

---

## 📌 Features

- Takes user input for age (via `prompt()`)
- Converts human age to dog years (1 human year = 7 dog years)
- Outputs the result to the console
- Includes basic input validation to handle non-numeric values

## 🚀 What I Learned

- How to use `prompt()` for user input in the browser
- The importance of type conversion (`Number()`)
- Basic conditionals for input validation
- Using `console.log()` for debugging and feedback
- Structuring a small project with JavaScript logic at the center

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML (basic setup)
- CSS *(still practicing and improving my styling)*
- JavaScript *(core logic — still learning how to fully connect JS to the DOM)*
- ChatGPT *(used to double-check and refine some parts of the code)*
